        <h1>Creative Process Against AI</h1>
        <p>In this project, I alongside an AI create a logo. I knew I wanted to do a logo but I had a hard time deciding on what type of business the logo should be based on. I started with a bit of concept mapping to get a better idea on the direction for this project.</p>

        <h5>Below is the prompt created based on the concept map.</h5>
        <blockquote>Create a logo for a bakery called “Nookie.” Nookie caters to people and their pets, making pastries for both people and their furry friends. Nookie is very community oriented and partners with local shelters to host an adopt-a-pal event every summer. They pride themselves in being a safe place for people and their pets, helping other pet owners connect with each other. Their tagline is “A nook for you & your furry friends.”</blockquote>

        <p>The first part of my project started with ideation and research. I combed through references through sites like Pinterest, Behance, and Dribble. It was by sifting through digital archives that I was able to see different styles of logos in regards to animals. Combing through images on the web, I started to pick and choose different elements of certain logos that I particularly liked and enjoyed. </p>
        <p>I started to sketch out my logo ideas and after sketches, I went into my digital roughs but had a hard time deciding on which logo to pursue. It was only after feedback from my classmates that I got a clearer picture of which logo to pursue.</p>
        <p>I experimented with colors and typefaces based on feedback before arriving to my final logo. I opted for a typeface was not static throughout, hoping to communicate a playful and welcoming attitude that balances the simplicty of the dog logo. I decided on a brown and mustard yellow color palette to represent a cozy feel [muted brown] with a spark of fun and energy [the yellow].</p>

        <p>For the artificial intelligence portion of my project, I relied heavily on my initial prompt shown earlier. I tried to remain as hands-off as I could to really let the focus be on the AI model. When making my prompt, I did keep in mind of an AI model and attempted to be as descriptive as possible.</p>
        <p>The initial portion of Side B relied heavily on just prompt creation. I entered it into a stable diffusion model provided by <a href="https://stablediffusion.gigantic.work/">Gigantic Work</a>. I generated 10 logos and chose one in order to test the second goal of this side, which is the feedback loop.</p>
        <p>Choosing the logo I thought to be the most promising to refine, I asked the AI Model to use the logo as reference and make improvements according to the prompt provided. While I had expected the logos to devolve in each generation, I found that it wasn't entirely the case. I do believe it became more generic with each generation and it lost the uniqueness that drew me to the original logo in the first place and I especially could not understand certain choices made by the AI. These choices being the color shift to a bright blue/green color that didn't really make sense in relation to both the prompt and the subject.</p>
